Parts: PC, Instruction Memory, REgisters, ALU, Data Memory

8 bit ALU: needs a one bit ALU which is then used iteratively in the 8bit ALU and
  contains all the logic for each of our required operations, the mux selects which one of these operations the ALU does for any given     instruction based on the address inputs to the mux

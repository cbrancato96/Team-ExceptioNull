Our basic instruction formats will be the following:

R: 4 bits Opcode, 2 bits Reg RS, 2 bits Reg Rt

I: 4 bits Opcode, 2 bits Reg RS, 2 bits Immediate

J: 4 bits Opcode, 4 bit Address Offset

Our Design considerations are the following:

First bit of the opcode decides whether the instruction is R or (I|J)

All of the our R instructions, except for move, have the destination register as the same register (ex:$t0). This means that we will
have four available registers for our instructions, including the default register.

Because of our design choice of making the common case have an implied destination register, the programmer needs to call the move command to
not overwrite previous results.

R Instruction Set
All instructions, unless otherwise noted, have rd implied as $t0.

0000 	Mv 	Mv is add with rt implied as zero for this instruction
0001 	Add 
0010 	And 
0011 	Not
0100 	Nor
0101 	Slt
0110 	Sll	Implied Shamt = 1, To shift by 2 call function Sll twice
0111 	Srl	Implied Shamt = 1, To shift by 2 call function Slr twice

J Instruction Set

1000	J
1001	Jal

I Instruction Set

1010	lw	
1011	sw
1100	beq	Implied that branch offset is in $t0
1101	bne	Implied that branch offset is in $t0
1110	addi	The destination reg is the source register
1111	li	The destination reg is the source register
